# Project "Labyrinth".
## Goals
- To explore different techniques in RL domain
- Compare performance of advanced RL methods with basic (Monte Carlo, Sarsa, Q-learning)
- Derive optimality criterea for using one or another family of learning algorithms

## Usage
 In console:
 
 - python manager.py
 
 All parameters are predefined in the Manager module for now.
